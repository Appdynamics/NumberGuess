# Android NumberGuess

A simple Android game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 20. Use this as an exercise to learn how to instrument an Android application with AppDynamics MRUM.

This version deliberately has no AppDynamics MRUM instrumentation except for the Constants class, where the AppDynamics key variable is stubbed out.

For more information on instrumentation, see-
